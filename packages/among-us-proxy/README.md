# Among Us Proxy

[See project page]('../../README.md')

## How to use it

1. Download last release from [releases](https://github.com/NickCis/among-us-proxy/releases).
2. Unzip the file
3. Open `powershell` and go to the folder where the binary was uncompressed
4. If you are going to be:
  - Host:
    1. Create a match on the LAN section
    2. On the powershell run `among-us-proxy.exe host`
    3. Guests should connect to `ws://<your ip>:8080` (You'll probably want to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/) to expose the `8080` port to the world.
  - Guest:
    1. On the powershell run `among-us-proxy-exe guest <host>`
    2. On the game, you'll find a _Proxy_ game on the Lan section, you should be able to connect to it.
